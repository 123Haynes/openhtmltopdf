GETTING OPEN HTML TO PDF
========
New releases of Open HTML to PDF will be distributed through Maven.  Search maven for [com.openhtmltopdf](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.openhtmltopdf). Current maven release is ````0.0.1-RC2````.

GETTING STARTED
========
There is a large amount of sample code under the openhtmltopdf-examples directory (integration guide and template guide to come).
You could try the browser example at ````/openhtmltopdf-examples/src/main/java/com/openhtmltopdf/demo/browser/BrowserStartup.java````

SIMPLE USAGE
========
Add these to your maven dependencies section:
````xml
  	<properties>
  		<!-- Define the version of OPEN HTML TO PDF in the properties section of your POM. -->  	       
  		<openhtml.version>0.0.1-RC2</openhtml.version>
  	</properties>

  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.openhtmltopdf</groupId>
  		<artifactId>openhtmltopdf-core</artifactId>
  		<version>${openhtml.version}</version>
  	</dependency>
  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.openhtmltopdf</groupId>
  		<artifactId>openhtmltopdf-pdfbox</artifactId>
  		<version>${openhtml.version}</version>
  	</dependency>
  	<dependency>
  		<!-- Optional, leave out if you do not need right-to-left or bi-directional text support. -->
  		<groupId>com.openhtmltopdf</groupId>
  		<artifactId>openhtmltopdf-rtl-support</artifactId>
  		<version>${openhtml.version}</version>
  	</dependency>
  ````
  Then you can use this code:
  ````java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import com.openhtmltopdf.bidi.support.ICUBidiReorderer;
import com.openhtmltopdf.bidi.support.ICUBidiSplitter;
import com.openhtmltopdf.pdfboxout.PdfRendererBuilder;
import com.openhtmltopdf.pdfboxout.PdfRendererBuilder.TextDirection;

public class SimpleUsage 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		new SimpleUsage().exportToPdfBox("file:///Users/user/path-to/document.xhtml", "/Users/user/path-to/output.pdf");
	}
	
	public void exportToPdfBox(String url, String out)
	{
            OutputStream os = null;
       
              try {
               os = new FileOutputStream(out);
       
               try {
                     // There are more options on the builder than shown below.
                     PdfRendererBuilder builder = new PdfRendererBuilder();

                     // The following three lines are optional. Leave them out if you do not need
                     // RTL or bi-directional text layout.
                     builder.useBidiSplitter(new ICUBidiSplitter.ICUBidiSplitterFactory());
                     builder.useBidiReorderer(new ICUBidiReorderer());
                     builder.defaultTextDirection(TextDirection.LTR);
        	 
                     builder.withUri(url);
                     builder.toStream(os);
                     builder.run();
                     
               } catch (Exception e) {
                     e.printStackTrace();
                     // LOG exception
               } finally {
                     try {
                            os.close();
                     } catch (IOException e) {
                            // swallow
                     }
               }
              }
              catch (IOException e1) {
                     e.printStackTrace();
                     // LOG exception.
              }
	}
}

HTML5 PARSER
============
While Open HTML to PDF works with a standard w3c DOM, the project provides a converter from the Jsoup HTML5 parser provided Document to
a w3c DOM Document. This allows you to parse and use HTML5, rather than the default strict XML required by the project. To use the converter, add this 
dependency:
````xml
  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.openhtmltopdf</groupId>
  		<artifactId>openhtmltopdf-jsoup-dom-converter</artifactId>
  		<version>${openhtml.version}</version>
  	</dependency>
````
Then you can use one of the ````Jsoup.parse```` methods to parse HTML5 and ````DOMBuilder.jsoup2DOM```` to convert the Jsoup document to a w3c DOM one.
````java
	public org.w3c.dom.Document html5ParseDocument(String urlStr, int timeoutMs) throws IOException 
	{
		URL url = new URL(urlStr);
		org.jsoup.nodes.Document doc;
		
		if (url.getProtocol().equalsIgnoreCase("file")) {
			doc = Jsoup.parse(new File(url.getPath()), "UTF-8");
		}
		else {
			doc = Jsoup.parse(url, timeoutMs);	
		}
		
		return DOMBuilder.jsoup2DOM(doc);
	}
````
Then you can set the renderer document with ````builder.withW3cDocument(doc, url)```` in place of ````builder.withUri(url)````.

PLUGGABLE HTTP CLIENT
=================
Open HTML to PDF makes it simple to plugin an external client for HTTP and HTTPS requests. In fact this is recommended if you are using
HTTP/HTTPS resources, as the built-in Java client is showing its age. For example, to use the excellent [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) library is
as simple as adding the following code:
````java
     public static class OkHttpStreamFactory implements HttpStreamFactory {
           private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
		
            @Override
            public HttpStream getUrl(String url) {
               Request request = new Request.Builder()
                 .url(url)
                 .build();

             try {
              final Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();

              return new HttpStream() {
                  @Override
                  public InputStream getStream() {
                      return response.body().byteStream();
                  }

                  @Override
                  public Reader getReader() {
                      return response.body().charStream();
                  }
             };
           }
           catch (IOException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }

           return null;
	  }
     }
````
Then use ````builder.useHttpStreamImplementation(new OkHttpStreamFactory())````.

CACHE BETWEEN RUNS - INTRODUCED IN RC3
=======
By default, Open HTML to PDF should not cache anything between runs. However, it allows the user to plugin an external cache. It should
be noted that the URI received by the cache is already resolved (see below). Here is a simple external cache:
````java
	public static class SimpleCache implements FSCache {
		private final Map<FSCacheKey, Object> cache = new HashMap<>();
		
		@Override
		public Object get(FSCacheKey cacheKey) {
			Object obj = cache.get(cacheKey);
			System.out.println("Requesting: " + cacheKey.getUri() + " of type: " + cacheKey.getClazz().getName() + ", got it: " + (obj != null));
			return obj;
		}

		@Override
		public void put(FSCacheKey cacheKey, Object obj)  {
			System.out.println("Putting: " + cacheKey.getUri() + " of type: " + cacheKey.getClazz().getName());
			cache.put(cacheKey, obj);
		}
	}
````
Of course, you may want to customize your cache by inspecting the URI or class name contained by cache key. Once you have a cache, you can set it
on the builder with ````builder.useCache(cache)````.

URI RESOLVER - INTRODUCED IN RC3
=======
By default, the code attempts to resolve relative URIs by using the document URI as a base URI. Absolute URIs are returned unchanged. If you wish to plugin your
own resolver, you can. This can not only resolve relative URIs but also resolve URIs in a private address space or even reject a URI. To use an external resolver 
implement ````FSUriResolver```` and use it with ````builder.useUriResolver(new MyResolver())````.

LOGGING
=======
Three options are provided by Open HTML to PDF. The default is to use java.util.logging. If you prefer to output using log4j or slf4j, adapters are provided:
````xml
  	<!-- Use one of these, not both. --> 
  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.openhtmltopdf</groupId>
  		<artifactId>openhtmltopdf-slf4j</artifactId>
  		<version>${openhtml.version}</version>
  	</dependency>
  	
  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.openhtmltopdf</groupId>
  		<artifactId>openhtmltopdf-log4j</artifactId>
  		<version>${openhtml.version}</version>
  	</dependency>
````
Then at the start of your code, before calling any Open HTML to PDF methods, use this code:
````java
  XRLog.setLoggingEnabled(true);

  // For slf4j:
  XRLog.setLoggerImpl(new Slf4jLogger());
  // or for log4j 1.2.17:
  XRLog.setLoggerImpl(new Log4JXRLogger());    
````

FAQ
===
+ No, you can not use it on Android or Google App Engine.
+ Flowing columns are not implemented.
+ No, it's not a web browser, although the 'browser' example is pretty impressive.
